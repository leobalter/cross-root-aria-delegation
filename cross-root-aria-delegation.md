# Cross-root ARIA Delegation API explainer

- [source](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/issues/917)
- [**WIP** spec draft](https://leobalter.github.io/cross-root-aria-delegation/)

It is critically important that content on the web be accessible. When native elements are not the solution, ARIA is the standard which allows us to describe accessible relationships among elements.  Unfortunately, it's mechanism for this is historically based on `IDREF`s, which cannot express relationships between different DOM trees, thus creating a problem for applying these relationships across a `ShadowRoot`.

Today, because of that, authors are left with only incomplete and undesirable choices:

* Observe and move ARIA-related attributes across elements (for role, etc.).
* Use non-standard attributes for ARIA features, in order to apply them to elements in a shadow root.
* RequirE usage of custom elements to wrap/slot elements so that ARIA attributes can be placed directly on them. This gets very complicated as the number of slotted inputs and levels of shadow root nesting increase.
* Duplicating nodes across shadow root boundaries.
* Abandoning Shadow DOM.
* Abdandoning accessibility.

It is important that this be addressed and authors able to establish, enable and manage important relationships.

This proposal introduces a delegation API which would allow ARIA attributes and properties set on a Web Component to be forwarded to elements inside of its shadowroot.

This mechanism will allow users to apply standard best practices for ARIA and resolve a large margin of accessibility use cases for applications of native Web components and native Shadow DOM. This API is most suited for one-to-one delegation, but should also work for one-to-many scenarios. There is no mechanism for directly relating two elements in different shadowroots together, but this will still be possible manually with the element reflection API.

The proposed extension adds a new `delegates*` (e.g.: `delegatesAriaLabel`, `delegatesAriaDescribedBy`) options to the `.attachShadow` method similarly to the `delegatesFocus`, while introducing a new content attribute `auto*` (e.g.: `autoarialabel`, `autoariadescribedby`) to be used in the shadowroot inner elements. This has an advantage that it works with Declarative Shadow DOM as well (though, it requires another set of HTML attributes in the declarative shadow root template), and it is consistent with `delegatesFocus`. The declarative form works better with common developer paradigm where they may not necessarily have access to a DOM node right where they are creating / declaring it.

```html
<span id="foo">Description!</span>
<template id="template1">
  <input id="input" autoarialabel autoariadescribedby />
  <span autoarialabel>Another target</span>
</template>
<x-foo aria-label="Hello!" aria-describedby="foo"></x-foo>
```

```html
const template = document.getElementById('template1');

class XFoo extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.attachShadow({ mode: "open", delegatesAriaLabel: true, delegatesAriaDescribedBy: true });
    this.shadowRoot.appendChild(template.content.cloneNode(true));
  }
}
customElements.define("x-foo", XFoo);
```

In the example above, the ARIA attributes assigned in the host `x-foo` are delegated to inner elements inside the component's shadowroot. Today, custom code can reflect this application but synthetically applying the aria attributes and their effects to both the host `x-foo` and its inner elements.

For instance when delegating `aria-label` it is desirable that readers know that it applies to the input, not both the input and the host. Current workarounds include copying the attribute over and removing it from the host, but this introduces other problems.

## Usage with Declarative Shadow DOM

This extension allows usage of attributes with [Declarative Shadow DOM](https://github.com/mfreed7/declarative-shadow-dom/blob/master/README.md) and won't block SSR.

Following the same rules [to add declarative options from `attachShadow`](https://github.com/mfreed7/declarative-shadow-dom/blob/master/README.md#additional-arguments-for-attachshadow) such as `delegateFocus`, we should expect ARIA delegation to be used as:

```html
<span id="foo">Description!</span>
<x-foo aria-label="Hello!" aria-describedby="foo">
  <template shadowroot="open" shadowrootdelegatesarialabel shadowrootdelegatesariadescribedby>
    <input id="input" autoarialabel autoariadescribedby />
    <span autoarialabel>Another target</span>
  </template>
</x-foo>
```

In the example above, the `<template shadowroot>` tag has the content attributes `shadowrootdelegatesarialabel` and `shadowrootdelegatesariadescribedby`, matching the options in the imperative `attachShadow`:

```javascript
this.attachShadow({ mode: "open", delegatesAriaLabel: true, delegatesAriaDescribedBy: true });
```

This mirrors the usage of delegatesFocus as:

```html
<template shadowroot="open" shadowrootdelegatesfocus>
```

being the equivalent of:


```javascript
this.attachShadow({ mode: "open", delegatesFocus: true });
```

For now, consistency is being preserved, but otherwise the ARIA delegation attributes can be simplified as:

```html
<span id="foo">Description!</span>
<x-foo aria-label="Hello!" aria-describedby="foo">
  <template shadowroot="open" delegatesarialabel delegatesariadescribedby>
    <input id="input" autoarialabel autoariadescribedby />
    <span autoarialabel>Another target</span>
  </template>
</x-foo>
```

# Appendix

## No silver bullet

Not all cross-shadow use cases are covered. Cases like radio groups, tab groups, or combobox might require complexity that is not available yet at this current cross-root delegation API.

The delegation API might also not resolve attributions from multiple shadow roots in parallel or attributes that would point to DOM trees containing the current host component.

## Thoughts: attribute names are too long

The attributes names such as `shadowrootdelegates*` are very long and some consideration for shorter names by removing the `shadowroot` prefix can be discussed as long the discussion is sync'ed with the stakeholders of the respective Declarative Shadow DOM proposal.

## Non-"aria" attributes

### OpenUICG Popup API

The OpenUICG is developing an API to support content that popsup over a page that a delegation API as outlined so far may benefit. In particularly, it can support better ergonomics on the API that they have currently documented for [using the new attributes in shadow DOM](https://open-ui.org/components/popup.research.explainer#shadow-dom). 

```html 
<my-tooltip popup=hint>
    <template shadowroot=closed delegates="popup">
      <div autopopup>This is a tooltip: <slot></slot></div>
    </template>
    Tooltip text here!
</my-tooltip>
```

With this small change to their implementation, you'd be able to access the
`.showPopUp()` method directly on the `<my-tooltip>` element, but have it act on the `<div>` within 
the shadow root without having to map those methods yourself. While their original example shield 
the parent application/component from sprouted attributes, adding `popup` to the `ElementInternals` 
dictionary, could allow for the best of both worlds.

### CSS Anchored Positioning

The current proposal for [CSS Anchored Positioning](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/CSSAnchoredPositioning/explainer.md) leveraged the `anchor` attribute with in ID Reference to bind the position on one element to another:

```html
<button id="myButton" popup="myPopup">Anchor</button>
<div id="myPopup" anchor="myButton" popup="auto">Anchored element</div>
<style>
    #myPopup {
        position: fixed;
        position-set: buttonMenuPos;
    }

    @position-set buttonMenuPos {
        // ...
    }
</style>
```

Decorating these elements with custom element wrappers for style encapsulation, addition DOM interlevening, etc. would require delegation of the `anchor` attribute to work correctly:

```html
<x-button popup="myPopup" id="myButton">
  <template shadowroot="open" delegates="popup">
    <button auto="popup"><slot></slot></button>
    <svg><!-- Popup Icon --></svg>
  </template>
  Anchor
</x-button>
<x-popup id="myPopup" anchor="myButton">
  <template shadowroot="open" delegates="anchor popup">
    <style>
      div {
        position: fixed;
        position-set: buttonMenuPos;
      }

      @position-set buttonMenuPos {
        // ...
      }
    </style>
    <div popup="auto" auto-anchor auto-popup>
      <slot></slot>
      <button aria-label="Close popup">x</button>
    </div>
  </template>
  Anchored element
</x-popup>
```
